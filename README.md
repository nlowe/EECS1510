# EECS 1510 - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming With Java
This is a repository containing the exercises and projects for EECS 
1510. If you have to do similar projects, feel free to use these as 
guidelines, I'm licensing them all under MIT.

## Style
Unfortunately, the professor of this course requires the use of the 
Allman Style for braces. This is not the style I'm used to using, so 
some formatting errors may slip through.

## Eclipse
The professor also requires the use of eclipse, which is why i'm 
including all of the eclipse-specific files and metadata in the 
repository.
